The internet works by connecting millions of devices through a global network. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown:

1. **Data Transmission** â€“ Information is broken into small packets and sent across networks.
2. **IP & DNS** â€“ Every device has a unique IP address. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates website names into IP addresses.
3. **Protocols** â€“ TCP/IP ensures data delivery, HTTP/HTTPS loads websites, and SMTP handles emails.
4. **Infrastructure** â€“ ISPs provide access, routers/switches direct traffic, and servers store data.
5. **Request-Response Cycle** â€“ Your browser requests a webpage, a server responds, and the browser displays it.
6. **Wireless & Mobile** â€“ Wi-Fi and cellular networks transmit data wirelessly.
7. **Security** â€“ HTTPS encrypts data, firewalls protect networks, and VPNs enhance privacy.

Essentially, the internet is a vast system that transmits data efficiently across the world. ðŸš€
