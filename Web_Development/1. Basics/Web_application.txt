A **web application** consists of three main parts:  

1. **Frontend (Client-Side)** â€“ The user interface built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (React, Angular, Vue.js). It handles user interactions and communicates with the backend via APIs.  

2. **Backend (Server-Side)** â€“ Processes requests, manages logic, and interacts with the database. Built using **Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring Boot), PHP, etc.**  

3. **Database** â€“ Stores and retrieves data using **SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase)** databases.  

**How it works:**  
1. User interacts with the frontend.  
2. Frontend sends a request to the backend.  
3. Backend processes the request and queries the database if needed.  
4. Data is returned to the frontend, which updates the UI.  

Everything is connected via the **internet, APIs, and HTTP/HTTPS protocols** to ensure smooth communication. ðŸš€
